### Hi there 👋 I'm Filip! :]

- 💻 I've been an Android developer since 2015.
- 📹 My primary job is being a **Lead Android Developer for Jetpack Compose** at [Stream](https://getstream.io/).
- ❤️‍🔥 Kotlin has been my primary language since early 2016 and I got recognized as the "Kotlin Guy" promoting this wonderful language!
- 👨‍🏫 I do a lot of public speaking engagement, mentoring and teaching in my spare time.
- 📚 I'm a [published book author](https://www.raywenderlich.com/books/kotlin-coroutines-by-tutorials/v2.0) and [tech editor](https://www.raywenderlich.com/books/saving-data-on-android/v1.0).
- 🏆 I'm also a [Google Developer Expert](https://developers.google.com/community/experts) in Kotlin & Android categories.
- 🎙️I'm running a podcast in Croatian called [IT Podcast Osijek](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCRpADFImlrUPSz8HYVRN1w)!
- 🤓🕹️ My hobbies are all the nerdy stuff - DnD, Video Games, MTG, board gaming.
- 🧗I'm extremely enthusiastic about climbing (lead & boulder), indoors and outdoors.
- ☕ If I ever helped you out with mentoring or problem-solving, you can [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/filbabic) to support my work!
